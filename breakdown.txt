Initial task: create a base model (SpeechPaceNN) that is trained
              to detect speech pace.
Dataset: common_voice from kaggle. The train, test, and validation
         were split evenly into three classes -- sped up, slowed down,
         and normal. Normal = 0, sped up = 1, slowed down = 2. These
         samples were also augmented with noise and pitch shifting. Then
         the MFCCs and deltas were extracted.
