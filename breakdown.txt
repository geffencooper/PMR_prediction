Initial task: create a base model (SpeechPaceNN) that is trained
              to detect speech pace.

Dataset: common_voice from kaggle. The train, test, and validation
         were split evenly into three classes -- sped up, slowed down,
         and normal. Normal = 0, sped up = 1, slowed down = 2. These
         samples were also augmented with noise and pitch shifting. Then
         the MFCCs and deltas were extracted (these are the input into the
         network). These are located in /data/perception-working/Geffen/SpeechPaceData/.

Next task: create a fusion model that uses visual features as well fused
           with the pretrained SpeechPaceNN model. This model tries to predict
           the PHQ_8 PMR subscore of the patient as a binary classification task.
